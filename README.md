#### Why another diff-tool?

There are many db-difference tools, but all the open source tools are incomplete or discontinued,
and we needed an up-to-date tool for quickly do this operation in a single command line step.

## Npm Installation

A global install is prefered.

```
$ npm i -g pg-compare
```

## Run

```
$ pg-compare [PATH_TO_CONFIG]
```
where *PATH_TO_CONFIG* is the config file path (with all DBs parameters).

## How it works

You just need to prepare a correct config json with all dbs parameters and then run this module: it will generate all SQL commands for the requested parameters.  

**N.B.**  
The generated SQL is the delta from schema1 to schema2 (schema1 = schema2 + delta)

#### Config file format

The right format of the config file is the one shown in the example.json file. 

`connection1` *(mandatory)* Parameters for the connection to the db1  

- `host` *(mandatory)* Host name
- `user` *(mandatory)* Username
- `password` *(mandatory)* Password
- `database` *(mandatory)* Database name

`connection2` *(mandatory)* Parameters for the connection to the db2  

- `host` *(mandatory)* Host name
- `user` *(mandatory)* Username
- `password` *(mandatory)* Password
- `database` *(mandatory)* Database name

`compare:` *(mandatory)* Parameters for the comparing execution  

- `schema` *(mandatory)* Schema parameters  

  - `tables` Flag to enable table comparing (including columns, primary key and unique constraints)
  - `fkeys` Flag to enable foreign keys comparing
  - `functions` Flag to enable functions  comparing
  - `indexes` Flag to enable indexes comparing (excluding indexes generated for primary keys)
  - `types` Flag to enable enum types comparing 
  - `views` Flag to enable views comparing
  - `sequences` Flag to enable current value comparing for sequences (a sequence must exist on both databases)
  - `rows` Array of table names; for these there will be a rows comparison
- `options` Comparing options  

  - `mode` (**full** or **preserve**) If *full* check which items of schema2 are not present in schema1 and generate SQL commands to drop them.
  - `owner` Owner of created  DB items. If not present, it will be the **connection2.user** value.

`output` output file path with SQL generated commands. If not present, SQL commands will be written in the console output.  

`verbose` Flag to enable a verbose log during the comparing operation.

## Test

Tested on PostgreSQL 9.4.  
A test file is available with many test cases. We recommend you to try it on two empty DBs.
